        The basis of our project is to create an interactive map depicting recent attacks in South Sudan.  
        This map will serve as an overall advocacy tool in addition to being directly incorporated into our annual reports on the conflict. 
        Its central use will be to provide international decision makers (UN member states, UN staff, and policymakers) with detailed, visual information about the conflict and the areas affected by it. 
        The goal is to better educate these decision makers and motivate them to draft resolutions or policies that will protect the civilians of South Sudan and ensure their long-term welfare.</div>

 The aim of my project was to gain a better visual understanding of where attacks are happening in South Sudan. Although the initial attempt was to focus on all land types, this project would shift its focus onto two major land classes: urban and water. 
        Analyzing attacks in the country between 2015 and 2017, this study would go on to prove that despite its extremely limited urban spaces and the fact that attacks have been spread throughout the countryside, significant portions of these attacks have occured within close proximity of urban areas as well as areas of water. 
        The project gives a percentage of attacks near each land type for each state, based on South Sudanâ€™s ten former administrative states. </div>
